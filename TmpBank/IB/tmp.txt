TODO: 
	1- USE babel later to traspile es6 js to es5 and *write down the steps as well
	2- DEBUG preprocessor exported value

	3- this impl is prone to bugs because there might be listeners added using addEventListener and they are before the addListener of our submit

	4- feature list in imlp docs

	5- features:
		AuthManagerControl:
			1- postBack sets the arg to -> current auth method type
			2- Container is gonna have templates as well as :GoogleAuth, DigitalSig(can have two methods itself), UserPass ... 


	6- known bugs:
		AuthManagerControl:
			1- fix GetPostBackEventArgumnetFor in BasePage
			2- fix perFormPostBack(...) in script1.js
	7- bug candidates:
		AuthManagerControl:
			1- in setupAuthMethods check if getControlWith* finds nothing what does it return, and if retuns an empty resultset then what resultset.Select() returns.
				Does it crash? * based on the result of research (code might change but its in _SetupAuthMethods):
					 change the result = _validateAuthMethods(container, AuthManagerUtils.TagNames.GOOGLE_AUTH + "AuthMethod", DigitalSigAuthMethodWrapperClass) 
					 	if result isnot nothing to [NEW CODE: resuls.count <> 0]

CURRENT TASKS:

	1- AuthManagerControl: validating the existance of templates is done through one function which we call multiple times 
	2- AuthManagerControl: different classes that handle auth method : client side
	3- AuthManagerControl: no more DSTargetAuthMethod -> maybe abstracing away how these things are checked
